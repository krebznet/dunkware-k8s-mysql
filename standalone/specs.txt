Single MySQL Server Instance Deployment
           REQUIREMENTS
1. No Replication or MySQL Clustering

2. Uses a persistent volume claim to a volume
that is available to the deployed k8 node.

3. Configure a node-port IP address or some other way
to expose mysql service port outside of kubernetes

4. We need a way to configure the mysql service config file in
our k8s scripts. Specifically the cache size property.
5. We would like to use a node selector to specify the target
k8s node to deploy on.

6. We need a way to specify the CPU and Memory resources that k8
makes available to it. For example we would want unbounded CPU
permissions and up to 32GIG of memory.


                MILESTONE 

I can then take this script and use it to deploy 5 different
mysql server instances in my k8 cluster where each instance is
deployed to a specific node we specify in deployment yaml files.
